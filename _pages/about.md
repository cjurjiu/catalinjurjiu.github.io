I'm a software engineer, focused on Android but always curious about other technologies. 

This is the place where I share some of my projects and other findings, miscellaneous code and tools I've playing with to lately.

I'm passionate about coding, planes[^1], space flight, new tech & many others.

Enjoy your stay here & feel free to get in touch.
